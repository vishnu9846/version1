                <p> 
                    Kappad Beach has historically played an important role in the history of Kerala. On these shores, over 500 years ago in 1498, 170 men led by Vasco- da-Gama first stepped onto Kerala.
                     The entire State, especially the Malabar Coast, would never be the same again
